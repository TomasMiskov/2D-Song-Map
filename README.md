# 2D-Song-Map
Final assignment for the Unsupervised Machine Learning course. Visualizing songs based on their audio features using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering.

## Python
The Pyhton folder includes the code for accessing the Spotify API and downloading the data set

## R
The R folder includes the analysis applied onto a matrix of euclidean distances between the audio features of the tracks. 
Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering solutions are tested

## Final Report
The final report files describe the process in a small paper/publication format
